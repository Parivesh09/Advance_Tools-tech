# Backend Architecture & Patterns

This directory contains comprehensive resources and learning paths for mastering backend architecture and design patterns.

## Learning Path

### 1. Monolith vs Microservices
- **Concepts to Learn:**
  - Monolithic architecture
  - Microservices architecture
  - Service boundaries
  - Communication patterns
  - Data consistency
  - Deployment strategies

- **Resources:**

  - [Martin Fowler's Blog on Microservices](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html)
  - Book: "Building Microservices" by Sam Newman
  - YouTube: "Microservices explained" by TechWorld with Nana

- **Practical Exercise:**
  - Convert a monolithic application to microservices
  - Implement service discovery
  - Handle distributed transactions

### 2. RESTful APIs vs GraphQL
- **Concepts to Learn:**
  - REST principles
  - HTTP methods and status codes
  - Resource modeling
  - GraphQL schema design
  - Queries and mutations
  - Resolvers
  - Apollo Server/Client

- **Resources:**
  - [REST API Tutorial](https://restfulapi.net/)
  - [GraphQL Official Documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/)
  - Book: "RESTful Web Services" by Leonard Richardson
  - Course: "GraphQL with React" on Udemy

- **Practical Exercise:**
  - Build a RESTful API with Express
  - Convert REST API to GraphQL
  - Implement real-time subscriptions

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Concepts to Learn:**
  - Message brokers
  - Event sourcing
  - CQRS pattern
  - Pub/Sub patterns
  - Eventual consistency
  - Kafka/RabbitMQ basics

- **Resources:**
  - [Kafka Documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/)
  - [RabbitMQ Tutorials](https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html)
  - Book: "Designing Event-Driven Systems" by Ben Stopford
  - Course: "Apache Kafka Series" on Udemy

- **Practical Exercise:**
  - Implement event-driven microservices
  - Build a real-time notification system
  - Create an event-sourced application

### 4. Authentication & Authorization
- **Concepts to Learn:**
  - OAuth 2.0
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
  - Session management
  - Refresh tokens
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - OpenID Connect

- **Resources:**
  - [OAuth 2.0 Specification](https://oauth.net/2/)
  - [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/)
  - Book: "OAuth 2.0 in Action" by Justin Richer
  - Course: "Authentication & Authorization" on Pluralsight

- **Practical Exercise:**
  - Implement OAuth 2.0 flow
  - Build JWT-based authentication
  - Create a role-based access system

### 5. Rate Limiting & Throttling
- **Concepts to Learn:**
  - Rate limiting algorithms
  - Token bucket
  - Leaky bucket
  - Distributed rate limiting
  - API quotas
  - Circuit breakers

- **Resources:**
  - [Rate Limiting Best Practices](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/rate-limiting-strategies-techniques)
  - Book: "Building Microservices" (Rate Limiting Chapter)
  - Redis Documentation for Rate Limiting

- **Practical Exercise:**
  - Implement rate limiting middleware
  - Create a distributed rate limiter
  - Build a circuit breaker pattern
